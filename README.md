timebox - A System Time Sandbox
===============================

This program uses dynamic library preloading to change the apparent system
time for instances of programs it executes.

This is useful for example, for testing your programs at interesting times
such as the crossing of DST boundaries without the inconvenience of actually
changing your system time.
